# PlayTube

PlayTube is a chrome extension with an end goal of being the best music streaming service around.  This will include publicly shared playlists, music discovery, unlimited individual playlists & unlimited songs per playlist.  Best of all, it will be entirely free.  Think Spotify with YouTube videos.


### Current Progress

Currently you can create individual playlists (stored locally) using the chrome extension.  You can control everything you might do normally on YouTube or spotify from within the extension (volume controls, song scrubber, unlimited skips, no ads (just YouTube ads)).


### Todo

* Shuffle (Ideally this will build a shuffled version of your playlist and play that - so the same song won't repeat until all other songs have played at least once)
* Multiple Playlists (Should be a drop-down somewhere to select current playlist)
* Synced Playlists (Not just stored locally, stored somewhere else)
* Music discovery (Would be nice to have a database of artists, albums & their songs linked to YouTube vids of each song - probably crowdsourced)
* Playlist sharing (publicly or to friends)
