# PlayTube

PlayTube is a chrome extension with an end goal of being the best music streaming service around.  This will include publicly shared playlists, music discovery, unlimited individual playlists & unlimited songs per playlist.  Best of all, it will be entirely free.  Think Spotify with YouTube videos.
