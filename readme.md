# PlayTube

PlayTube is a chrome extension with an end goal of being the best music streaming service around.  This will include publicly shared playlists, music discovery, unlimited individual playlists & unlimited songs per playlist.  Best of all, it will be entirely free.  Think Spotify with YouTube videos.


### Current Features

* Simple button embedded on YouTube video pages to add songs to your playlist
* Synced playlist across any chrome browser logged into your google account
* Beautiful UI for organizing your favorite songs and playing them
* Shuffle


### Usage

* [Install the chrome extension][1]
* Navigate to a YouTube video you want to add to your playlist
* Click the extension button, and click the "+" button in the top right to add the song to your playlist
* Use the controls to control your playlist
* Note you can also add videos with the "+ Save" button on the YouTube page itself (top right of video description)

### Todo

* Multiple Playlists (Should be a drop-down somewhere to select current playlist)
* Music discovery (Would be nice to have a database of artists, albums & their songs linked to YouTube vids of each song - probably crowdsourced)
* Playlist sharing (publicly or to friends)
* Converting YouTube playlists into PlayTube playlists
